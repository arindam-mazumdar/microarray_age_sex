    "Microarray data in genetics refers to a type of high-throughput technology used to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Microarrays are composed of small glass slides or silicon chips on which thousands of microscopic spots, known as probes, are deposited in an orderly grid pattern. These probes are short DNA sequences or fragments that are complementary to specific genes or regions of the genome. Each spot represents a particular gene or DNA sequence. The results are typically strored in a .CEL file. To process a .CEL file we go thourgh the following steps\n",
